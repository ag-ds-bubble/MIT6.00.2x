### Q1) Which of the following populations has the largest variance?

- [ ] [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- [ ] [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- [x] [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 6]


### Q2) Which of the following populations has the largest variance?

- [ ] [3, 3, 5, 7, 7]
- [x] [1, 5, 5, 5, 9]

### Q3) If a number is removed from a population, the standard deviation of that population will always decrease.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

### Q4) You are taking samples of the ages of two populations, A and B. Population A is all the residents of San Francisco, while Population B is all the residents of Los Angeles.
### The sample from Population A has a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 1. The sample from Population B has a mean of 45 and a standard deviation of 15. Which of the following are certain?

- [ ] You will not find an individual in Population A that is over the age of 37.
- [ ] The average age of Population A is lower than the average age of Population B.
- [x] The average age of the sample of Population A is lower than the average age of the sample of Population B.
- [ ] If the sample size of each population is 10, then you can conclude that your sample accurately represents the population.
- [x] A sample size of 1 million is more appropriate than a sample size of 10 for these populations.


### Q5) The 95% confidence interval for a normal distribution of data with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2 is 5 +/- ________
> 3.92
