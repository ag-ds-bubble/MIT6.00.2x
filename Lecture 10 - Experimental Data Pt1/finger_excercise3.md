## Finger Excercise 3

### Recall from the previous video the concept of the coefficient of determination, also known as the  R2  value. This is computed by  1âˆ’(variability of errors)2(variability of data)2 . The variability of the errors is computed by taking the sum of the squares of (observed - predicted) errors. We normalize this variablity by dividing it by the variability of the data, which is sum of the squares of (observation - average_observation) for each observation.

### In this file, this  R2  value is computed by the function rSquare.

### In that file, revise fitData and fitData3 to report the coefficient of determination for the fitted line in each case. Did this measure of the "goodness of fit" improve when we eliminated the measurements after the spring reached its elastic limit and Hooke's Law no longer applied?
