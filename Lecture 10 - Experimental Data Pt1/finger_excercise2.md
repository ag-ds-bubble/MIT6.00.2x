### Q1) Which of the following lines will fit a parabola to the spring data given in the lecture file, springData.txt? Check all that work.

- [ ] a,b = pylab.polyfit(xVals, yVals, 2)
- [x] model = pylab.polyfit(xVals, yVals, 2)
- [x] a,b,c = pylab.polyfit(xVals, yVals, 2)


### Q2) Suppose the coefficients returned by polyval are in the tuple (c1, c2, c3). Which of the following lines calculate the estimated y values?

- [x] estYVals = c1*xVals**2 + c2*xVals + c3
- [ ] estYVals = c3*xVals**2 + c2*xVals + c1
