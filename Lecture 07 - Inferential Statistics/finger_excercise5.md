## Finger Exercise 5

### In the lecture, you saw a uniform and a normal distribution. There is another type of distribution, called an exponential distribution. For the following real-life situations, fill in the blank with the appropriate distribution model (normal, uniform, or exponential) that would best simulate the situation.
