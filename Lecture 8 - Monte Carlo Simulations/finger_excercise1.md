### Suppose we have an experiment. We toss a coin  m  times. Each time we collect results from a sample of size  n  and compute this sample's mean  μi  and standard deviation  σi . This experiment has an underlying distribution with mean  μ  and standard deviation  σ .

### Q1) Which of the following does the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) guarantee (for large enough  n  and  m ):


- [x] The sample means will be approximately normally distributed.
- [x] The sample means will have a mean close to the mean of the original distribution  μ .
- [x] The sample means will have a variance close to the variance of the original distribution divided by the sample size  (σ)2n .
