## For questions 1 and 2, consider our previous problem (permutations of 3 students in a line).

### Q1) When represented as a tree, each node will have how many children?
> **2**

### Q2) Given two permutations, what is the maximum number of swaps it will take to reach one from the other?
> **3**

## For questions 3 and 4, consider the general case of our previous problem (permutations of n students in a line). Give your answer in terms of n.

### Q3) When represented as a tree, each node will have how many children?
> **n-1**

### Q4) Given two permutations, what is the maximum number of swaps it will take to reach one from the other?
> **0.5*n(n-1)**
